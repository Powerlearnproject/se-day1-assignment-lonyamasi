Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is basically the application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. These involves design, dev, testing,deployment and maintenance of software products. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
There were three key Milestones in the evolution of software engineering:
1. Development of programming languages like Fortran and C
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This is where the systems requiirements are gathered and user needs are documented.
Design: The high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created
Implementation: Code is written and the software is built according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the user or customers
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile is iterative and incremental approach, focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes.
Military or Aerospace Projects will likely use the waterfall methodoloy since they require rigorous documentation and strict compliance.
An e-commerce website would require continuous updates and feature enhancements thus, agile methodology would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer,is responsible for writing code and implementing software materials.
A QA engineer, ensures the software is good quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES provide comprehensive tools for writing code, debugging and testing code. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio, Eclipse, PyCharm etc
Vesrion contol systems are used to track changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members examples are Git and SubVersion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2.  Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3.  Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3.  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4.  Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is basically crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Its important since it helps us capitalize on AI by getting clear and concise results from our prompts. . It helps us avoid vague and confusing answers from AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is ,what is HPV? 
The improved prompt is: "Explain what HPV (Human Papillomavirus) is, including its causes, symptoms, transmission, and prevention. Keep the explanation simple and suitable for someone with no medical background."
Our improved prompt has:
A Specific Focus – Covers causes, symptoms, transmission, and prevention instead of just "What is HPV?"
ATarget Audience – Uses simple language for non-medical readers.
Very Clear Expectations – Asks for an explanation, not just a definition.
